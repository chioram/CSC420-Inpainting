NEURAL NET IMPLEMENTATION:

Our neural net was implemented in Google Colab. Make sure to use GPU option.

Please find links to code and data for the Project below:

Inpainting Neural Net Colab Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tCzeWqZOfejIwFjyYJ3s_4jaqSnPMP4w?usp=sharing

Train Data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kvFlcGzSTzL--GKhJarhzsHcfJI4iuO0?usp=sharing
Validation Data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kYu26WW0ko2xpM88CSP2-DQHgQSaOvgu?usp=sharing

Folders and files should be placed in the root folder of your drive when mounting to Colab.
See variables {data_root} and {data_root_val} for folder paths for train and validation
data respectively.
